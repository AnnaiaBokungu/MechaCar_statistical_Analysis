## Summary statistics on Suspension Coils
### Based on the current manufacturing data the total of all manufacturers does meet the design specification. As shown below, the variance for all three lots falls below 100 lbs per squre inch. When looked at individually, we can see from thr image below that Lot 1 and Lot 2 do meet the design specification, but lot 3 exceeds it.

### T-test on Suspension Coils 
### Based on the results it appears that for Lot 1 and Lot 2, the mean PSI is not statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. We can conclude this because the assumed population mean of 1500 lbs per squre inch falls within the confidence intervals of both Lot1 and Lot2 as shown in the image displayed below. The confidence interval for Lot 3 does not include the population mean of 1,500 lbs per square inch, therefore, we can conclude that the PSI is statistically different from thr population mean.
